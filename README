We are pleased to announce the version 1 release of Ellipsis3D.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

Once you have built the package, you can test it on the chemical plume
example

  ./ellipsis3d Examples/Ellipsis3D_2004_examples/chemical_plume.input

Let it run as long as you like.  Then munge the data for OpenDX with
the commands

  cd Examples/opendx/scripts/
  ./get_node_files_dx_format.mk
  ./get_particles_dx_format.mk

Now run dx on the file

  Examples/opendx/chemicalplume/particles_isosurface_glyph.net

By default, it will show the first time step.  Change the input files
to get later time steps.  You should see a picture like
